# Interactive-Form
 Project 3 Treehouse Techdegree

## Project Overview
For a fictional Full Stack conference, which is already developed with HTML and CSS, I further develop the website with JavaScript so that the user has a more interactive experience. Certain elements will be activated that the users are free to choose based on their decisions before. The costs of the chosen workshops and the main conference are calculated. With regular expressions I prove that the data that has been entered into the forms is always in the correct format. If it isn't correct, the user will be noticed with signs and hints in red colour.

## Motivation
This project is part of the Treehouse Techdegree path for becoming a Full Stack Java Script Developer. It is the third project out of totally 10 projects in this education.
